## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline Workflow

This project uses a Jenkins pipeline to automate the integration and deployment process. The workflow is defined in the `Jenkinsfile` and consists of the following stages:

1.  **📦 Build Docker Image**: Compiles the application and builds a Docker image using the `Dockerfile`.
2.  **🧪 Run Tests**: Executes automated tests against the new build to ensure code quality and functionality.
3.  **🛡️ Scan for Vulnerabilities**: Uses Trivy to scan the Docker image for any `HIGH` or `CRITICAL` vulnerabilities before it can be pushed.
4.  **🚀 Push & Deploy**: If the build is on the `main` branch and all previous stages pass, the pipeline pushes the verified Docker image to Docker Hub and triggers a deployment.

### Local Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git)
    cd your-repository
    ```

2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
